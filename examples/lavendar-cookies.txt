INSTRUCTIONS
1. Make The Lavender Sugar Cookies - Grind the dried lavender buds with 1 tablespoon of the measured sugar to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle.
2. Combine the butter, remaining sugar, and lavender sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the whisk attachment, cream the butter on medium-high speed for 4 to 5 minutes, or until pale and fluffy.
3. While the butter is mixing, whisk the yogurt, milk, corn syrup, and vanilla together in a small bowl. Stop the mixer, add the yogurt mixture, and continue to mix on high speed until well combined, about 1 minute.
4. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt to the bowl. Switch to the paddle attachment and mix on low speed until everything combines to a soft dough, about 1 minute.
5. Lay a piece of plastic wrap out on a work surface. Dump the dough onto the middle of the plastic and shape into a 7 to 8-inch (18 to 20-cm) disc, about 1-inch (3-mm) thick, with your hands. Wrap the dough with the plastic and place it in the fridge for one hour.
6. After the fridge wait, Line a plate, or a small baking sheet that will fit in your freezer, with parchment paper.
7. Unwrap the dough and cut it in half. Re-wrap one half and return it to the fridge. Place the other half of dough on a work surface dusted with flour.
8. Let the dough sit at room temperature for 3 to 5 minutes.
9. Use a rolling pin to roll it to approximately ¼-inch (3mm) thick.
10. Cut the dough into circles using a 2-inch (5mm) round cookie cutter, or other cookie cutter of your choice (see notes). Place the dough circles on the plate or sheet you have ready. If the dough doesn't lift off of the work surface in the cutter, use a small offset spatula to transfer. Place as many of the cookies on the sheet as you can. It doesn't matter how close they are because you are going to chill the dough in the freezer at this stage. Once you have cut as many circles as you can, reform the dough into a disc, reroll, and cut again.
11. Place the cut cookies in the freezer.
12. Repeat the last few steps for the cookie dough in the fridge.
13. Leave the cookies in the freezer for 20 minutes.
14. Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Line a standard baking sheet with parchment paper. When the 20 minutes of freezing time is up, transfer 12 frozen cookies to the sheet and bake 9-11 minutes or until very pale gold around the edges. Transfer the cookies to a rack to cool and repeat baking until all cookies from the freezer are baked.
15. When the last batch of cookies is in the oven, remove the second half of the dough from the fridge and repeat - roll, cut, freeze, and bake. Cool the cookies completely before glazing.


16. Make The Earl Grey Glaze - Heat milk in the microwave until hot but not boiling. (I used a heat-proof glass measuring cup.)
17. Steep Earl Grey tea bag for 15 minutes, squeezing it with a spoon from time to time. Remove the tea bag and allow the milk to cool.
18. Mix the sifted powdered sugar, corn syrup, vanilla, and ½ teaspoon of London Fog (tea w/milk).
19. Continue to add London Fog by the ½ teaspoon, stirring well between each addition, until the glaze is thick, but will still drip, similar to the consistency of honey. That will be roughly 7-9 times. (You'll have leftover London Fog, use it for whatever you’d like to or discard.)


20. Dip The Cookies In The Glaze - Pour the Earl Grey glaze in batches onto a small plate. Hold a cookie upside down by the edges and lay it on top of the glaze. Lift the cookie straight up before it sinks down to its edges and let the glaze drip straight down back onto the plate. Once the drips have slowed down, quickly flip the cookie right side up, and lay it on a rack for the glaze to harden. Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick before the glaze sets. Let sit one hour, and up to overnight for the glaze to harden.
